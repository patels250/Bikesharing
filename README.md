# Bikesharing

## Project Overview

This analysis was conducted to examine trip data from Citibike to determine if moving Citibike to Des Moines would be a logical business move. We examine the breakdown of bike ride users as well as summary statistics of various factors. A link to the dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitibikeAnalysis_16349563012730/CitibikeAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Results

### Top Starting Locations

This is a map of where bike rides are most often started in NYC. The bigger and darker bubbles indicate a higher number of rides started.

### Gender Breakdown
![graph2.PNG](Resources/graph2.PNG)

This pie chart shows the gender breakdown of all Citibike users. 1,530,272 users are Male, 588,431 users are Female, and 225,521 users are Unknown.

### Checkout Times for Users
![graph3.PNG](Resources/graph3.PNG)

This graph shows that most rides are less than 30 minutes long. The most common length of a ride is 5 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
![graph4.PNG](Resources/graph4.PNG)

This graph shows the previous results broken down by gender. It clearly shows that most users are Male.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![graph5.PNG](Resources/graph5.PNG)

This graph shows when the bikes are most often used. Bikes are most used around 8am and around 5-6pm on weekdays (presumably to commute to and from work). On weekends, bikes are used in the late morning and all afternoon.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
![graph6.PNG](Resources/graph6.PNG)

This graph shows the previous results broken down by gender. There is not much difference at what time each gender uses bikes the most, but this graph again shows that Males are the biggest demographic of users.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![graph7.PNG](Resources/graph7.PNG)

This graph shows a breakdown of bike use by day, filtered by user type and gender. The largest demographic by far is Male subscribers, followed by Female subscribers.

## Summary

Overall, it appears Citibike is a very successful business in New York City. Thousands of bike rides are taken every hour. One recommended visualization to examine would be a pie chart that breaks down how many users are Customers and how many are Subscribers. Another recommended visualization would be a breakdown of the users by Age.
